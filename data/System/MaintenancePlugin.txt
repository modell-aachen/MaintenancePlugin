%MP_CHECK%

---++  Restrictions / Known Bugs

   * The file permission check is experimental. If it runs into files containing characters not in the locale-defined \w, such as german umlauts, the resulting search with File::Find will taint the result, which will cause the check to fail. Since we can not really change File::Grep's unicode settings, we suggest moving using the rename functionality to rename the page and change all incoming links. Will be automated soonish. Sorry.%BR%%BUTTON{"Check excluding experimental checks" href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/%WEB%.%TOPIC%?mpcheck=safe"}%

---++ API version 7

---+++ maintenanceHandler (experimental)

The MaintenancePlugin looks for a sub =maintenanceHandler= in the namespace of modules meeting one of the following conditions:
   * A module in lib/Foswiki/Plugin that is correctly installed (Module key is in LocalSite.cfg) and ={Enabled}=.
   * Module in lib/Foswiki/Contrib that resides in a file matching /Contrib\.pm/.

If available, the sub =maintenanceHandler= will be executed without parameters. This is the recommended place to use the registerCheck API. Use reponsibly.

---+++ registerCheck( $name, $newcheck )
You can use the registerCheck API to add your own checks to the MaintenancePlugin.
   * =$name= the technical name of the check. Can overwrite existing checks.
   * =$newcheck= a reference to a hash containing:
      * =name= - Common name of a the checked item
      * =description= - Description of the detected problem
      * =check= - a reference to a perl subroutine, which must return a hash reference structured as follows
         * =result= - =0= if no error is found, =1= if no error is found.
         * =priority= - mandatory if =result= is not =0=. Defines the severity of the found error.
            * =$Foswiki::Plugins::MaintenancePlugin::CRITICAL= - Issue needs to be fixed now, or will possibly prevent wiki from functioning correctly.
            * =$Foswiki::Plugins::MaintenancePlugin::ERROR= - Issue should be fixed, or might prevent components from working.
            * =$Foswiki::Plugins::MaintenancePlugin::WARNING= - Issue might affect certain components in a negative way.
         * =solution= - mandatory if =result= is not =0=. Text containing information on how to solve the problem.
      * =experimental - , optional

*Example*

<verbatim>
registerCheck("general:replaceifeditedagainwithin", {
    name => "ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin set correctly",
    description => "{ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin} set to 0",
    check => sub {
        my $result = { result => 0 };
        if (( exists $Foswiki::cfg{ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin}) and ($Foswiki::cfg{ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin} != 0)) {
            $result->{result} = 1;
            $result->{priority} = $Foswiki::Plugins::MaintenancePlugin::WARN;
            $result->{solution} = "Set {ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin} to 0";
        }
        return $result;
   }
});
</verbatim>
