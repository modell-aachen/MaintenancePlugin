---++  Restrictions / Known Bugs

   * If the file permission check runs into files containing characters not in the locale-defined \w, such as german umlauts, the resulting search with File::Find will taint the result, which will cause the check to fail. Since we can not really change File::Grep's unicode settings, we suggest moving using the rename functionality to rename the page and change all incoming links. Will be automated soonish. Sorry.
